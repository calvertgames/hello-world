# hello-world
Couch to 5K (getting back into coding shape)

Simple concept ... Christmas 1982 (or maybe 1983), I got a Commodore 64 for Christmas.  I was 12 or 13; I'm old.  A life-long passion was born.  Life evolves, and while I still love technology and have a great job as a VP leading engineering teams, I no longer code.  Can I change that ...?

Should I dare try #100DayOfCode? https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-crazy-history-of-the-100daysofcode-challenge-and-why-you-should-try-it-for-2018-6c89a76e298d/

Or at least a modified version for self learning, which is what this readme attempts via a simple "hello-world" tutorial:  https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
